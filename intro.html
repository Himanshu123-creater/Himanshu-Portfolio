                    <h1><br>About me:- <br><br></h1>
                    <p>I'm a dedicated and passionate student currently in Class 12 with a strong interest in programming and technology. I have gained proficiency in several programming languages, including Python, Java, CSS, HTML, SQL, and more. My curiosity about coding started early, and over time, I've honed my skills through various projects and self-learning. Whether it's building websites with HTML and CSS, writing algorithms in Python, or managing databases with SQL, I enjoy solving problems and creating efficient solutions. I love experimenting with different technologies to broaden my knowledge and am always eager to learn new concepts. Besides programming, I am also actively involved in school activities, which helps me develop strong communication and teamwork skills. My ultimate goal is to pursue a career in computer science, where I can apply my skills and creativity to make a meaningful impact.</p>
